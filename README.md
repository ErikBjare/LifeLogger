LifeLogger
==========

A webapp for logging and analyzing data generated by our daily lives so that we can optimize for what matters to us.

## Technologies used:
These are currently only propositions, and are subject to change.
 - Flask, an excellent microframework (might change in the future)
 - peewee, ORM used together with Flask thanks to flask-peewee
 - peewee-compatible database (SQLite, MySQL or PostgreSQL)
 - MongoDB, to store users logdata (might change in the future)
 - Vagrant, for easy testing and deployment
 - Chef or Puppet, for configuration management
